Start with a number of ants (10-30) in a compact region.

Any square they pass over becomes yours.

A square which is yours has, over the course of a turn, a random chance (1/20?) to spawn an ant.

Two ants may not occupy the same square. If an ant and an opposing team's ant attempt to occupy the same square, they
will both be annihilated and the square will become neutral.

HOW TO ANTS:

Store entire map in memory (2d vector)

Create threads to open
