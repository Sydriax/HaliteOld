AI Game Halite:

Your objective is to conquer the entire map. The map will consist of an x-by-y grid, with x and y guaranteed to be at
least 20, and, for frame rate purposes, no greater than 500.

You control an army of crystals. Each turn, you can send a list of moves to your crystals, with a location of the crystal you
wish to control and one of five directions: NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST, or STILL (no move) to move it. Each crystal at most moves one
square during your turn. One should also send a control to every crystal in their control, as one without instructions will
die of loneliness.

Any square that one of your crystals passes over becomes owned by you, during a turn, any square which is owned by you
has a random.
