# Halite

Halite is a game played by AIs. Halite is built in C++ using OpenGL 2.0. It is primarily developed by [Benjamin Spector](https://github.com/Sydriax "Benjamin Spector") with help from [Michael Truell](https://github.com/truell20 "Michael Truell").

Halite includes a lightweight library for writing AIs in C++. We are working on porting Halite to Java and Python.
