# Halite

Halite is a game played by AIs. It is built in C++ using OpenGL 2.0. Halite is primarily developed by [Benjamin Spector](https://github.com/Sydriax "Benjamin Spector") with help from [Michael Truell](https://github.com/truell20 "Michael Truell").

Halite includes a lightweight library for writing AIs in C++, Java, and Python.

This is a publish-only repository of some of Halite's old code. Release of the full project (website, game manager, complete starter packages) will be released soon!
